        Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart. Work that paint. We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch. Don't fiddle with it all day. Every day I learn. No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen.
        
        Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy. Maybe there's a happy little Evergreen that lives here. Brown is such a nice color. That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want. It's important to me that you're happy.
        
        It's life. It's interesting. It's fun. Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here. It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet. It's cold, but it's beautiful. This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart. Isn't that fantastic?
        
        As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll. In life you need colors. We're trying to teach you a technique here and how to use it. Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect.
        
        I'm a water fanatic. I love water. Let your imagination be your guide. We'll play with clouds today. Do an almighty painting with us. Take your time. Speed will come later.
        
        A beautiful little sunset. There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. I get carried away with this brush cleaning. Water's like me. It's laaazyÂ ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things
        
        Imagination is the key to painting. Nothing wrong with washing your brush. Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here. Let's build some happy little clouds up here. Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain.
